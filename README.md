# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Daniel Brown

I'm an aspiring data proffesional and current MSc Data Science student with a background in mathematics, business analysis, and automation.


By day, I  work in the corporate finance department at Heidelberg Materials, specifically within Accounts Payable. Outside of work, I build data science and engineering projects using Python, SQL, and other tools.

This portfolio showcases the real-world projects Iâ€™ve completed across automation, machine learning, data visualisation, and analytics.
